## The `vtable`

- Stands for virtual table
- Used to support dynamic (run-time) polymorphism
- It is an array of pointers to the virtual functions of the class
- Each object of the class has a pointer to this `vtable`
- When a virtual function is called on an object, the call is resolved at runtime by looking up the function pointer in the `vtable`
- Allows the correct function to be called based on the object's actual type.

## Inheritance vs Composition

#### Inheritance
- Derived class inherits the properties and behavior of the base class
- Best used when there is a clear hierarchical relationship
- Example: `Vehicle -> Car`

#### Composition
- Class is composed of one or more objects of other classes (components), meaning it has these objects as members
- Best used for building complex types by combining objects of other types
- Example: `Car = {Engine, Wheels, etc..}, Bike = {Wheels, Chain, etc...}`


## Typecasting

C++ provides several types of cast:
- `static_cast` - For safe, compile-time checked conversions between related types
- `dynamic_cast` - For safe down-casting with run-time type checking and only works with polymorphic types.
- `const_cast` - For adding or removing the `const` qualifier.
- `reinterpret_cast` - For low-level reinterpreting of bit patterns, used with caution.

C-style casts (`(type)object`) are no longer in use because they are dangerous, performing any one of the above casting types without restriction/checking. 

This leads to bugs and undefined behaviour. 


## Keywords
### Uses of `const`

- Constant variables - can't be changed after declaration
- Constant pointers to values: `int* const ptr`
- Pointers to constant values: `const int* ptr`
- Constant pointers to constant values `const int* const ptr`
- Constant member functions (do not modify object state) `void func() const;`
- Constant parameters - prevent modification of parameters

### `inline`

Expands a function in-line when called instead of performing flow control transfer. 

Basically keeps the function within the current stack frame instead of generating a new frame for it.

### `std::atomic`

A template class that provides atomic operations on variables. Used for [[Concurrency & Multithreading]]. 

An atomic operation is an operation that is completed without interference from other threads. This is crucial to avoiding race conditions. More on [[Concurrency]]. 

Operations on atomic types are performed as a single, indivisible step, ensuring data consistency across different threads.
