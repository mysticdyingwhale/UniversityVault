#cs 

The C++ Standard Library (STL) is a collection of classes and functions that provide a set of common data structures, programming tools, and algorithms. It is available in all C++ compliant compilers. 

Its components are defined in the `std` namespace.

The STL includes containers, algorithms, and iterators, which simplify development of C++ applications.

## Containers

The most commonly used containers provided by STL are:

### Vector
A dynamic array that can resize itself.

Accessed through `#include <vector>`

### List
A [[University/CS/Data Structures and Algorithms 1134/Linked Lists|Doubly Linked List]].

Accessed through `#include <list>`

### Set
A sorted set of unique elements.

Accessed through `#include <set>`

### Map
A sorted key-value associative container. ([[University/CS/Data Structures and Algorithms 1134/Maps|Maps]])

Accessed through `#include <map>`

### Stack
A LIFO data structure ([[University/CS/Data Structures and Algorithms 1134/Stacks & Queues|Stacks]])

Accessed through `#include <stack>`

### Queue
A FIFO data structure ([[University/CS/Data Structures and Algorithms 1134/Stacks & Queues|Queues]])

Accessed through `#include <queue>`


## Algorithms

STL includes a set of generic algorithms which perform common tasks, including searching, sorting, and manipulating elements. 

Accessed through `#include <algorithm>`


### [[Sorting Algorithms]] 

`sort` and `stable_sort`

### [[Searching Algorithms]]

`find` and `binary_search`

### [[Copying|Modifying]]

`copy` and `transform`

### Numeric Operations

`accumulate`, `max_element`, and `min_element`


## Iterators

Iterators provide ways to access and traverse elements in a container.

They act as generalizations of pointers and allow algorithms to work with different types of container in a uniform way.

The STL offers:

- Input Iterators - Read-only access to a sequence of elements.
- Output Iterators - Write-only access to a sequence of elements.
- Forward Iterators - Allow both read and write operations.
- Bidirectional Iterators - Allow traversal in both directions.
- Random Access Iterators - Provide direct access to any element in constant time.

## Functors

The STL supports the concept of functors (also known as function objects) that can be used as arguments to algorithms. 

Functors are classes that behave like functions and can be customized to provide specific functionality.
